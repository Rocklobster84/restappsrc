It builds integrated technology stacks that are customized for solving different physics problems.  The hardware, and numerical algorithms are optimized together for fastest execution. This new approach results in unprecedented simulation speed. For a compressible flow problem with 100 million unknowns, Flexcompute solves Navier-Stokes equation with a turbulence model within 300 seconds. Such a problem would normally take 10 hours for a conventional flow solver running on a 1000-core cluster. This revolutionary speed opens a new dimension for engineering. Extensive product optimization and performance databases can be built within a day instead of weeks. Flexcompute's solver technology is trusted and already used for production by leaders in the urban air mobility and semiconductor industries. <a href="https://www.flexcompute.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.flexcompute.com</a>

							Optimal Solutions Software, LLC, offers Sculptor a CFD design program that provides the ability to parameterize CFD models and perform real-time shape deformation without the need to revisit the CAD model. When coupled with design optimization algorithms, Sculptor performs automatic CFD shape optimization. These tools help eliminate the numerous iterations inherent in the design process were one modifies the CAD model, remeshes, and then completes the CFD analysis. Optimal Solutions' Arbitrary Shape Deformation (ASD) technology used by Sculptor automatically, in real-time, alters shapes that are typically very complex and hard to manipulate into designs that improve performance - without having to remesh. The deformations are smooth and volumetric to maintain cell quality for the CFD calculations. When coupled with Pointwise's reliable CFD meshing, Sculptor helps find more accurate designs in less time, resulting in appreciable amounts of time and money being saved. <a href="http://www.gosculptor.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.gosculptor.com</a>
