					Fluid flow performance and behavior are becoming increasingly important for the design of automotive vehicle shape and key components with increasing pressure to improve design performance while reducing cost and time to market. The goal is to generate optimal design shapes within the available space that provide the desired performance for specified design goals such as drag, lift, swirl and tumble, flow uniformity, noise reduction, material reduction, and reduced energy requirements.

				<p>
					ENGYS leveraged open-source CFD and in-house developed adjoint optimization technologies coupled with Pointwise<sup>&reg;</sup> powerful meshing capabilities to deliver highly innovative and efficient flow performance-based topology optimization for automotive design applications.
				</p>

				<h2>Combining Pointwise and HELYX Adjoint makes CFD performance-based optimization practical</h2>

				<p>
					One of the key challenges related to CFD performance-based optimization is the complexity of geometry upgrades and remeshing in the process.  This can easily become overly complex, difficult to manage, possibly unstable, and expensive in terms of both effort and time. To overcome this challenge, ENGYS combined high-quality unstructured mesh generation for CFD from Pointwise with HELYX Adjoint to provide efficient and effective topology optimization of automotive components.
				</p>

				<p>
					Pointwise provided the underlying automatic meshing of surfaces and volumes to provide high-quality consistent CFD meshes. The high-quality unstructured meshing in Pointwise was a fundamental key to enabling stability of the CFD solutions, which are an integral part of the fully automated performance-driven adjoint-based topology optimization. If the mesh generation is not consistent between design iterations, the optimizer can be led astray to a non-optimum design.

				</blockquote>

				<p>
					The combination of HELYX Adjoint with Pointwise meshing resulted in efficient, stable, and effective design optimization of automotive components for fluid performance design goals.
				</p>

				<h2>Continuous Adjoint Methodology in Helyx Adjoint</h2>

				<p>
					The adjoint method in HELYX Adjoint leverages the calculation of sensitivities that provide insight into shape changes to improve performance. These sensitivities are then used by Helyx Adjoint to drive surface shape optimization or topology optimization of a volume.
				</p>

				<p>
					HELYX Adjoint leverages an open-source CFD solver with in-house developed adjoint-based topology optimization that evolves the volume boundary through an immersed level set approach. In simpler terms, the mesh is generated for the available design space and does not change. The shape boundaries of the design volume are then determined through an iterative level set approach based on the design performance goals, results, and sensitivities.

				</figcaption>

				<p>
					The immersed boundaries generated by HELYX Adjoint also use curvature to control the manufacturability of the final shape.
				</p>

				<h2>Automotive HVAC Duct Design</h2>

				<p>
					The first application case for topology optimization explored by Daniel Combest of ENGYS was topology optimization of an automotive HVAC duct. The first step was to determine the available package design space with one inlet and one outlet.
				</p>

				<p>
					The next step was to determine the case setup for HELYX Adjoint.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>HELYX Adjoint case setup
						<ul>
							<li>Flow characteristics
								<ul>
									<li>Air at a constant temperature </li>
									<li>Incompressible flow (7 [L/s])</li>
									<li>k-w SST turbulence model (primal)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Mesh Characteristics
								<ul>
									<li>Unstructured mesh with tetrahedra cells (330,000) converted to arbitrary polyhedral (63,000)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Optimization Objectives
								<ul>
									<li>Minimize power loss</li>
									<li>Minimize total volume</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<img data-src="images/Fig2-HVAC-Duct-800x460.png" alt="Optimized Automotive HVAC Duct Flow Performance"
					 class="img-fluid center-block" />
				<figcaption>
					Figure 2: Optimized Automotive HVAC Duct Flow Performance
				</figcaption>

				<p>
					The automatic topology optimization in HELYX Adjoint converged to the overall shape in less than 100 iterations and a final state geometry in 300 iterations that captured all relevant physics and reduced power loss by 33 percent and volume by 52 percent.
				</p>

				<h2>Motorsport Intercooler Design</h2>

				<p>
					The second application case explored by Dr. Combest of ENGYS was topology optimization of a motorsport intercooler. The first step was to determine the available package design space with one inlet and two outlets.
				</p>

				<p>
					The next step was to determine the case setup for Helyx Adjoint.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>HELYX Adjoint case setup
						<ul>
							<li>Flow characteristics
								<ul>
									<li>Incompressible flow at 50 l/s</li>
									<li>Approximate tube bundle as porous media with preserved volume of tubes</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Mesh Characteristics
								<ul>
									<li>1.6 million tetrahedral cells converted to 307k polyhedral</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Optimization Objectives
								<ul>
									<li>Minimize volume </li>
									<li>Minimize curvature for manufacturability</li>
									<li>Minimize power loss</li>
									<li>Maximize uniformity</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<img data-src="images/Fig3-Motocross-Intercooler-800x450.png" alt="Optimized Motorsport Intercooler"
					 class="img-fluid center-block" />
				<figcaption>
					Figure 3: Optimized Motorsport Intercooler
				</figcaption>

				<p>
					The automatic topology optimization in HELYX Adjoint then converged to the overall shape in less than 300 iterations and a final state geometry in 750 iterations that captured all relevant physics and reduced power loss by 20 percent and volume by 20 percent.
				</p>

				<p>
					This design case had multiple objectives that conflict with each other. Therefore, Dr. Combest decided to further explore the influence on Darcy-Forchheimer Coefficient and tube bundle length. This was possible due to the automation and efficiency of the approach. Each optimization case took only 49 minutes.
				</p>

				<img data-src="images/Fig4-Intercooler-Variations-800x383.png" alt="Motorsport Intercooler Design Variations"
					 class="img-fluid center-block" />
				<figcaption>
					Figure 4: Motorsport Intercooler Design Variations
				</figcaption>

				<p>
					From the various optimization runs, it was possible to select the best design for each objective and to evaluate design options that would balance the objectives. Higher porous losses with the largest porous media length resulted in the most uniform flow, while the lowest porous losses and shortest porous media resulted in the best pressure loss.
				</p>

				<h2>Just the beginning</h2>

				<p>
					The two examples of performance-driven Topology Optimization for automotive components are just the beginning of the exploration of how HELYX Adjoint can be used with Pointwise meshing to transform the makes CFD performance-based optimization practical. The next steps include investigation of mesh morphing and the use of Glyph scripting in Pointwise to broaden the capabilities and applicability of this revolutionary approach. Dr. Combest and the team at ENGYS plan to work with Pointwise, and Pointwise customers to further explore the potential impact of this approach on real-world applications that require optimal fluid flow performance.

								Autonomous vehicles are expected to become a viable form of transportation sometime in the first half of this century. One of the major hurdles will be to provide these cars with the artificial intelligence they need to position themselves in a location where there is less drag for optimal fuel efficiency, travel time, and stability. Ultimately, it should lead to fewer serious accidents and safer roads. Find out how Pointwise is helping researchers in the automotive industry do that.
