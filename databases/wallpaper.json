The four engineers on the wining team have varying degrees of mesh generation experience and specialization. Their collaboration resulted in a variety of grids with differing approaches for both geometries involved.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3>About the Grid</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe poster's leading image featured an exhaust fan, gridded with a multi-block structured approach for the passages through the fan blades. Conversely, the White House surface mesh was created using an advancing front algorithm, utilizing quad-dominant cells. The inspiration for the poster was the 1996 blockbuster film Independence Day.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Formula 1 Tire Wins Inaugural Pointwise Wallpaper Contest</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe are proud to announce that Tessa Uroić's grid, Formula 1 Tire, won the Wallpaper Contest 2015.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"images/Uroic-Wallpaper-Preview.png\" class=\"img-fluid center-block\" alt=\"A block structured mesh around an asymmetrical Formula 1 tire with grooves\"/>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"text-center\">Click on the size you want to download.</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"images/Uroic_tire_1920x1080.png\" download><img data-src=\"images/button-Wallpaper-1920x1080.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Uroic Wallpaper 1920x1080\" /></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"images/Uroic_tire_2560x1440.png\" download><img data-src=\"images/button-Wallpaper-2560x1440.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Uroic Wallpaper 2560x1440\" /></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"images/Uroic_tire_3200x1800.png\" download><img data-src=\"images/button-Wallpaper-3200x1800.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Uroic Wallpaper 3200x1800\" /></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-md-3\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"images/Uroic_tire_5120x2880.png\" download><img data-src=\"images/button-Wallpaper-5120x2880.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Uroic Wallpaper 5120x2880\" /></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3>About the Artists<br /><small>Tessa Uroić, University of Zagreb </small></h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTessa Uroić graduated from Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Zagreb in 2014 with diploma thesis: Constrained optimization of a tube bundle heat exchanger under uncertainty, supervised by Prof. Hrvoje Jasak and Dr. Henrik Rusche. She is currently a Ph.D. student working as a member of Prof. Jasak's computational fluid dynamics (CFD) group in Zagreb. Besides working on a Ph.D. thesis (Implicitly coupled algorithms) and industrial projects, she is responsible for generating meshes for the entire group.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3>About the Grid</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA block structured mesh around an asymmetrical Formula 1 tire with grooves. The wheel has a negative camber angle which made the mesh more complicated to make. It has eight million cells and it was used in OpenFOAM® simulations as a test case for comparison of different solvers. Results were presented at the 10th OpenFOAM Workshop in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>","__v":0}
