It is the first release of Gridgen to be written using the OpenGL 3D graphics application programming interface. Other new additions for this version are full support for trimmed surfaces, a scripting language interface for automating repetitive tasks, and a more robust three-dimensional elliptic grid generator. </p>  <p> &quot;At first, we thought converting Gridgen to OpenGL would help us internally by making porting to more graphics hardware easier but would be transparent to our users,&quot; said John P. Steinbrenner, Vice President for Research &amp; Development at Pointwise. &quot;However, we found that this was also a good opportunity to make Gridgen's graphics operations faster and tighter. We ended up with about a 30 percent speedup for most graphical operations and for some manipulations we are seeing a full order of magnitude speedup. Plus, we are getting the portability we wanted.&quot; </p>  <p> Version 12 is the first release to support a text based interface in addition to Gridgen's traditional graphical interface. The text interface can be used to automate parametric studies, run large problems in batch mode, and set user preferences. </p>  <p> This is also the first version of Gridgen to include an interactive, three-dimensional, elliptic grid generator. Past versions required the use of an external batch program. The three-dimensional, elliptic grid generator is used to optimize grid point distributions on volumes that will be analyzed with computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis software. </p>  <p> Gridgen is used by engineers and scientists to construct meshes for use with CFD and finite-element analysis software. In use since 1984, it is recognized for its coherent graphical interface and for giving its users fine control of grid spacing, orthogonality, and smoothness, all of which affect the accuracy of analysis results. Gridgen is a complete preprocessing toolkit that includes geometry modeling, IGES import, grid generation, and direct interfaces to software packages including TEAM, NPARC, VSAERO, INCA, GASP, CFX, FLUENT, FLUENT/UNS, RAMPANT, TASCflow, STAR-CD, Phoenics, PATRAN, and NASTRAN.

This version adds automatic geometry cleanup and a wider variety of grid elements. </p>  <p> Gridgen's automatic geometry cleanup saves engineers time by relieving them of hours spent at a workstation manually removing gaps and overlaps in a CAD model so that it is suitable for analysis. Instead, the CAD model is meshed and Gridgen automatically merges adjacent mesh surfaces that are within a user-specified tolerance, effectively meshing over gaps in the CAD model. Mesh merging may also be performed interactively to account for gaps that vary in size across the model. </p>  <p> Using this technique, the geometry cleanup and triangular surface grid generation for the sport utility vehicle shown here can be completed in less than 15 minutes. Manual repair would take hours, if not days. </p>  <p> Also new in Gridgen V13.3 are prism and pyramid grid elements. Prism elements are extruded from a triangular surface grid (shown in yellow in the sport utility vehicle above) to provide fine resolution of flow gradients, such as the boundary layer along an exterior surface. Pyramid elements are used to interface between hexahedral and tetrahedral cells. With these new element types, Gridgen can generate high quality grids for even more complex shapes. </p>  <p> Gridgen is known for its: </p>  <ul> <li>highly usable, interactive interface using OpenGL<sup>&reg;</sup> graphics, on Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> and Unix<sup>&reg;</sup>,</li> <li>geometry modeling tools, robust IGES import, and fault-tolerant gridding methods that let analysts work effectively with large and less-than-perfect geometry models, </li> <li>automated and richly featured gridding methods that allow users to create good grids right from the start,</li> <li>FREE Gridgen training (both basic and advanced) for all clients, and </li> <li>filters to export grid and boundary conditions data formatted for use with a wide variety of analysis software including FIELDVIEW, NASTRAN, PATRAN, UCD, VRML, STL, ADPAC, CFDSHIP, CFX-4, CFX-5, COBalt, FDNS, UNIC, FLUENT, GASP, GUST, INCA, NPARC, OVERFLOW, PHOENICS, SCRYU, STAR-CD, TASCflow, TEAM, TETREX, VSAERO, and WIND.</li> </ul>  <p> Concurrent with the Gridgen V13.3 release, Pointwise announced a free training program for Gridgen customers.

Work on the 24 month research project, titled Geometry and Grid Modeling for Numerical Simulation (GGMNS), began in November 2002. </p>  <p> The goal of the GGMNS project is to develop an API to serve as a programming guideline for researchers developing new unstructured meshing techniques. AFRL and other agencies often fund such development with the hope that the new techniques will be incorporated into meshing applications for the benefit of the end user. However, without a standard API, the software implementation of meshing research often requires considerable rework for integration into existing software. The rework is often sufficiently large that integration is never attempted or completed, and the end-user never benefits from the results of the research. A standard API would also benefit meshing researchers by allowing them to use existing meshing applications as frameworks for their research, rather than spending resources developing their own application frameworks. </p>  <p> Pointwise leads a broad industry team on the GGMNS project.

The 6-month effort (with a potential 3-month extension), was awarded under the <a href=\"http://www.navysbir.com/\">Navy's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program</a>. </p>  <p> The lack of integrity in CAD data is one impediment to the effective use of CFD for solving engineering problems of interest to the Navy. One example of a simulation impeded by poor CAD data involves aircraft operating in and around a ship's airwake. These CFD simulations are hindered by the fact that CAD data for the ship and/or aircraft when delivered to the engineer is not suitable for CFD meshing due to two main problems. The first problem involves geometric surfaces that don't properly fit together and instead contain gaps and overlaps (more specifically, they &ldquo;leak&rdquo;). The second problem involves excessive detail, both in the number of entities used to define the geometry (for example, using thousands of surfaces to define the hull) and in the level of geometric detail included in the CAD file. </p>  <p> The current process for handling CAD geometry is for the engineer to manually repair the CAD file to the extent practical and then deal with the remaining complexity during CFD meshing.  The research to be performed by Pointwise will study the feasibility of using a software tool to automatically make the CAD geometry suitable for CFD meshing. In other words, make the surface geometry &ldquo;watertight&rdquo;. </p>  <p> Dr. John Steinbrenner, Pointwise's Vice President of Ressearch and Development and Principal Investigator for this contracted research, foresees the long term benefits of this project. &ldquo;Problems with CAD geometry are the biggest problem with applied CFD today.

For example, starting from a quadrilateral surface mesh on a turbine blade, a layers of hex cells can be extruded with the upper and lower boundaries adhering to the hub and shroud surfaces, respectively. A second example involves extruding a mesh off a wing with the inboard boundary adhering to the fuselage. </p>  <p> GridgenGlyph, Gridgen's Tcl-based scripting language, includes two new capabilities that make it easier than ever for engineers to customize Gridgen for their particular applictions. A Glyph call has been added for entity selection so that a scripted application can provide flexibility in terms of which portion of the grid it operates on.

Two new capabilities in the software add to Gridgen's ability to read native format CAD files and handle sloppy geometry models. Specifically, a Native CAD Reader for Unigraphics and a visual tool for identifying gaps and overlaps were added. </p>  <p> Available since early 2002, Gridgen's Native CAD Readers provide the ability to read geometry from a CAD system's native files. Native access avoids translation errors that can occur when using open standard file formats. Because native access is integrated into Gridgen, there's no plug-in that an engineer has to execute from within the CAD system. In fact, use of the CAD system and its license are completely unnecessary - Gridgen reads the file directly. Native CAD Readers are available for CATIA<sup>&reg;</sup> V4, Pro/ENGINEER<sup>&reg;</sup>, STEP, and now Unigraphics<sup>&reg;</sup>. Based on an early trial of this technology, engineers at Lockheed Martin in Dallas, Texas, plan to incorporate Gridgen's Pro/ENGINEER Native CAD Reader into their CFD meshing processes. </p>  <p> Gridgen tolerates CAD model faults while meshing. Instead of forcing engineers to repair gaps and overlaps in the geometry to construct a watertight solid, Gridgen lets the geometry be meshed as is. During the meshing process, Gridgen applies a suite of highly automated, global and local tools to merge the mesh over gaps in the CAD geometry. Gridgen's latest release includes a new interactive visual mode for merging in which problem areas are highlighted so the user can quickly select them and have them automatically repaired. </p>  <p> These two new tools are the latest additions to Gridgen's suite of techniques for working with CAD geometry. Gridgen features a hybrid geometry capability that allows mixed-used of analytical (NURBs) and discrete (STL, wireframe) geometry. The software also includes geometry modeling tools that can supplement CAD geometry with various curve and surface types, including intersections. In this way, Gridgen lets the engineering analyst concentrate on the mesh and analysis, and not the idiosyncrasies of the geometry. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing engineering analysts today: mesh generation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

This saves valuable CAD seats and lets Gridgen users read CAD files sent to them from remote locations even when they do not use the CAD system that generated the geometry. </p>  <p> &quot;CATIA V5 is the fifth Native CAD Reader type we'll have added to Gridgen,&quot; said John Chawner, Pointwise's president. &quot;We are continuing to add more types as customers demand, so I guess the CAD systems we support now give some idea about the type of people using Gridgen.

Over the past decade, unstructured and hybrid meshing technology has been added, and the software has been ported to all the major brands of Unix, Linux, Windows, and Mac. Geometry modeling capability has been added including the ability to work with native CAD data formats and tri-faceted data. Native interfaces have been added to all major CFD solvers and new de facto standards like CGNS. Completely automated mesh generation has been achieved with the introduction of Gridgen's scripting language for the development of templates and macros. &quot;Our customers have kept us quite busy during the last decade,&quot; says John Steinbrenner, Vice President of Research and Development and co-founder. &quot;It has been very exciting to develop, introduce, and then see all these new technologies in use.

This latest release of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) meshing software features major additions to Gridgen's geometry modeling capabilities including trimmed surface creation and IGES export. </p>  <p> The ability to create trimmed surfaces and add or remove edges from trimmed surfaces solves a major problem faced by CFD analysts - how to work with the untrimmed or poorly trimmed geometry that is obtained from a CAD system. &ldquo;Lost trimming information, due to tolerance issues during translation, is a notorious source of problems for the analyst in the CAD-CFD data exchange&rdquo; said John Chawner, Pointwise's president. &ldquo;With Gridgen V15.07, the trimmed surfaces can be recovered easily using these new techniques.&rdquo; For the analyst creating entire models within Gridgen or supplementing existing models with new geometry, more complex and realistic models can now be created using trimmed surfaces. </p>  <p> Several new geometry import/export capabilities let Gridgen assume the role of the analyst's &ldquo;geometry hub&rdquo;.  Using the new IGES file export, the analyst can save their analysis-ready geometry, including layers, names, colors, and other organizational data, in a CAD-standard file format for reuse in other CAE disciplines such as structural mechanics, thermal, and electromagnetics. IGES export is especially useful when Gridgen's Native CAD Readers have been used to bring together design geometry from a variety of sources including Pro/ENGINEER<sup>&reg;</sup>, Unigraphics<sup>&reg;</sup>, CATIA V4<sup>&reg;</sup>, and the newly-added CATIA V5<sup>&reg;</sup>.

Development of API V2 was recently completed for the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) by a Pointwise-led team including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Basis Software. </p>  <p> The purpose of the API is relatively simple. By specifying how meshing technologies are to be implemented in software, meshing algorithms may easily be integrated into existing meshing applications if both conform to the API specification. For example, AFRL uses several meshing applications in their day-to-day computational research while also funding development of new meshing technology. Currently, it is difficult to integrate new technology into an application because the two are written by different authors: different function names, argument lists, return values, data structures, etc. Rather than reengineer either the application or the technology, a common API could be used by both the application developers and technology researchers resulting in seamless integration. Conceivably, the API could allow new meshing technology to be integrated in a plug-and-play fashion. </p>  <p> Boeing has already incorporated the UGC API into their in-house meshing framework. Todd Michal, Associate Technical Fellow, describes the results. &quot;The UGC API has been selected as a standard software programming interface within Boeing. Preliminary implementations of the API have been incorporated into a handful of Boeing's engineering design applications. Incorporation of the UGC API will enable seamless sharing of technology and software tools between software development efforts within Boeing and with external vendors. Use of a standard interface will also improve our ability to integrate meshing technologies into software that traditionally has not had a direct connection to the meshing tools. Adoption of the UGC API by the aerospace industry will allow new meshing technologies to be rapidly transitioned into our analysis tools and provide Boeing's engineers with the ability to select the best available software for the job at hand.&quot; </p>  <p> The API supports mesh generation for 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D linear and quadratic elements that are triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral, pyramidal, prismatic, and hexahedral. The API specifies C as the standard programming language. Other programming languages such as Fortran77 and Fortran90 are supported via wrappers (example wrappers are provided with the API). The API consists of a collection of pre-defined interface definitions and specifications on how software tools are to interact using the API. The API is designed to permit multiple meshing libraries to be linked into a single application. </p>  <p> Recently, the UGC API was recognized by the 14th International Meshing Roundtable with their Meshing Maestro Award. </p>  <p> The API's namesake, the Unstructured Grid Consortium (UGC), was formed in 1999 by AFRL and Boeing as a forum for facilitating the exchange of unstructured grid technology and has grown to include eleven member organizations from government, industry, and academia. In 2004 the UGC became a working group of the Meshing, Visualization, and Computational Environments Technical Committee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Both approaches provide the analyst with tools for handling sloppy CAD geometry. Fault tolerant meshing avoids the issue of CAD repair by directly \"healing\" the mesh over gaps and overlaps through computations of proximity and adjacency. \"Solid meshing takes a different approach,\" said John Chawner, Pointwise's president. \"By importing solid data directly or assembling solids in Gridgen, the mesher is able to determine adjacency implicitly from the CAD topology. This makes the mesher much more efficient because it doesn't have to compute proximity.\" Also, in addition to supporting solid models, Gridgen V15.09 supports quilts, topologically linked surfaces that are to be meshed as a single unit. John Chawner continues: \"Instead of working with literally hundreds or thousands of individual CAD entities that are the unfortunate result of CAD file generation and translation, the analyst can distill the geometry to the \"engineering topology\" consisting only of tens of entities. Instead of having 100 surface fragments that describe the suction side of a turbine blade, for example, they can simply work with 1 entity: the blade suction side.\" </p>  <p> Other new features released in Gridgen V15.09 include a deformation-based scheme for pyramid cell generation in hybrid meshes, a new native interface to the FrontFlow flow solver, upgraded native interfaces to the FIELDVIEW CFD postprocessor and the Cobalt and STAR-CD flow solvers, and ports to AMD Opteron (Windows and Linux), and the SGI Prism. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing engineering analysts today: mesh generation for CFD.

The major new feature in Gridgen V15.10 is a novel technique for generating high-quality unstructured meshes for viscous CFD analysis called anisotropic tetrahedral meshing. </p>  <p> &quot;Anisotropic tetrahedral meshing is a truly unstructured extrusion process,&quot; said John Steinbrenner, Pointwise's Vice President of Research and Development. &quot;Because it is unstructured, we can locally adjust the extrusion to improve cell quality and prevent collisions with adjacent extrusion fronts. This is very useful for those complex geometry cases where traditional prism extrusion fails: sharp corners, closely-spaced adjacent parts, and concave regions. The end result is our users will be able to create high quality CFD meshes more quickly than using other methods.&quot; </p>  <p> Gridgen's new anisotropic tetrahedral meshing is a highly automated technique for generating layers of high quality tetrahedra around complex geometries. Its advantages over traditional prism extrusion techniques are: </p>  <ul> <li>it can extrude out of convex regions,</li> <li>it automatically detects and avoids collisions with other extrusions,</li> <li>it can stop locally in regions where cell quality criteria are not being met, and</li> <li>it can handle high aspect ratio tetrahedral cells.</li> </ul>  <p> Together these improvements in Gridgen mean users are able to finish the meshing task more quickly and reliably for today's large, high-fidelity, 3D models. </p>  <p> Other significant new features in Gridgen Version 15.10 include a native interface to the Tecplot visualization software and an interface to CAD data via CADNexus' CAPRI software. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing engineering analysts today: mesh generation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

In addition, it provides shortcuts through the meshing process like a new automated assembly procedure that builds three-dimensional volume grids from a jumble of grid components with a simple click of a button. Pointwise's usability is further enhanced by a multiple-level undo and redo capability with a user configurable number of levels. </p>  <p> &quot;Our design goal was to streamline the user's grid generation experience and to build a new code foundation on which to more rapidly implement new features in response to our customer's changing needs&quot; said Chris Fouts, chief architect of the new software. &quot;With the new, intuitive interface, users can already generate their desired grids much easier and faster, and we are looking forward to a rapid pace of future developments as well.&quot; </p>  <p> &quot;Work on our Gridgen meshing software began in 1984,&quot; said Dr. John Steinbrenner, Pointwise's Vice-President of Research &amp; Development. &quot;Gridgen represented a huge jump in meshing capability at the time because of its graphical user interface. Pointwise offers another huge time-saving jump by following the same philosophy we had back in the beginning: Automate everything you can, but always give users enough control to finish their job when the automation can't.&quot; </p>  <p> Besides simplifying the meshing process, Pointwise also introduces unified geometric curve and grid curve drawing, simultaneous transformation of CAD geometry and grid, improved CGNS support including import, and the ability to access up to 16 Exabytes of memory with its 64-bit architecture. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing engineering analysts today: mesh generation for CFD.

We have been very fortunate to have grown consistently through the years and to have assembled an extremely talented and professional staff.  However, it's only when we look at what our thousands of customers have accomplished that our achievement becomes clear.&quot; </p>  <p> Pointwise began in 1994 with the Gridgen software, which remains the company's cornerstone product. </p>  <p> &quot;Looking back, it's hard to recognize the original version of the product,&quot; said Dr. John Steinbrenner, Pointwise's vice president for research and development. &quot;New developments in today's Gridgen focus on automated generation of large hybrid meshes including resolution of viscous boundary layers with our T-Rex<sup>TM</sup> technique. Also, recently sponsored research has resulted in new capabilities to be released in 2010. Because it's a mainstay of the aerospace industry, we remain dedicated to continued development of Gridgen in the years to come.&quot; </p>  <p> In 2007, the company's next-generation Pointwise software was first released. Based on lessons learned in the previous 23 years of Gridgen development, the new Pointwise architecture provides both an improved user experience and a framework for the next 15 years and beyond. &quot;Generating grids is an ugly business and customers had been telling us that improvements were needed to the workflow and user interaction. Pointwise is a direct result of that user feedback,&quot; said Chawner. &quot;In addition, Pointwise was our opportunity to address customers' requirements such as large mesh support (64-bit), undo and redo, multi-core computing, and software customization.&quot; </p>  <p> &quot;We have worked hard for the last 15 years to make our software the best it can be and I am gratified by the loyalty of our customers and the way they have participated in helping us achieve our standards for excellence,&quot; said Dr. Richard Matus, vice president of sales and marketing. &quot;The relationships we have built with these highly capable people have helped us produce products and services that meet the demands of an exacting industry.

An optional post-processing step combines adjacent tetrahedra into pyramid and prism elements in the extrusion layer. Prism recombination was frequently halted in previous versions by mesh quality issues and cell topology restrictions on symmetry planes. By removing many of these limitations in the new Gridgen Version 15.15, final cell counts can be reduced dramatically. Customers benefit because a smaller grid requires less memory, runs faster in the CFD solver and produces results sooner. </p>  <p> &quot;A 27 million cell mesh for a modern, complex fighter aircraft was reduced to 12 million cells, and similar reductions were obtained for the AIAA shock boundary layer interaction benchmark case,&quot; said Steinbrenner. &quot;Combined with the automation of this technique, these smaller meshes make hybrid meshing very effective for the CFD practitioner.&quot; </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing engineering analysts today -- mesh generation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Solid Meshing is a faster, better alternative to repairing the geometry directly.&quot; </p>  <p> Solid Meshing comprises solid models and quilts. Models are watertight collections of surfaces. Quilts are subregions of the geometry that capture engineering intent, simplify the topology, and are meshed as a single unit. The Solid Meshing suite includes tools for trimming and untrimming surfaces; solid model import; and multi-tiered tools for automatic and manual model and quilt assembly.

Close oupling of meshing and OGA has the potential to significantly reduce the effort required to generate overset grids by making OGA visible to guide meshing and ensure the most accurate and effective grid overlaps. </p>  <p> &quot;For a long time, Gridgen has been very popular within the overset grid community for its geometry handling, surface meshing, and structured hexahedral volume gridding,&quot; said Nick Wyman, director of applied research at Pointwise. &quot;Expanding our tool set to include the assembly process was the logical next step in the evolution of the product. Customer input heavily influenced how this feature set was implemented.&quot; </p>  <p> Overset gridding is an alternative to multi-block grids. In a multi-block grid, the three-dimensional domain is decomposed into regions (blocks), each of which is filled with a structured hexahedral grid (also called a mapped mesh). The blocks connect to each other with complete point-to-point matching. Because a multi-block topology can be time consuming to create for a complex shape like an aircraft, a time-saving alternative is an overset topology. In an overset grid, the blocks don't abut - they overlap. The goal of OGA software, therefore, is to compute how to interpolate information from one block to the next and ensure that interpolation is accurate. </p>  <p> &quot;Pointwise has been happy to sponsor the bi-annual symposium on Overset Composite Grids and Solution Technology since 1998 and we'll be present at this year's event to share this new development with the community,&quot; said Wyman. </p>  <p> Also included in Gridgen V15.16 are improvements to the tet-to-prism cell recombination algorithm used with the T-Rex hybrid meshing technique that can reduce overall cell count in some cases by 28 percent and a native build for Intel-based Macs running OS X 10.4 and newer, including OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing engineering analysts today - mesh generation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Adding baffles to T-Rex provides that resolution.&quot; </p>  <p> T-Rex (anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion) is an automated meshing technique that starts from a triangulated surface mesh and extrudes layers of high aspect ratio tetrahedra that transition to a more uniform mesh away from the body. The addition of T-Rex support for baffles (an existing Gridgen feature for resolving thin geometric surfaces) lets the user insert a triangulated surface mesh into the middle of the volume in the vicinity of a flow feature. T-Rex will extrude layers of tets from the baffle, thereby providing a fine mesh for accurately resolving the flow feature. </p>  <p> Also included in Gridgen V15.17 is further improvement of T-Rex's ability to combine, as a post-processing step, stacks of extruded tets into prisms to reduce cell count and thereby improve performance of the user's CFD solver.

Openings are limited, so early registration is advised. </p>  <p> Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is heavily used in designing horizontal axis wind turbines because their size and interactions with the surrounding environment prohibit environmental, experimental testing. Time-saving techniques for generating accurate CFD meshes are, therefore, particularly valuable to the wind energy industry. The amount of effort spent on research and development of more efficient green energy designs has increased along with demand. Horizontal axis wind turbines have become one of the largest sources of green energy. </p>  <p> Dr. Sideroff is a technical sales engineer for Pointwise.

T-Rex extrudes layers of high-quality tetrahedra (with included right angles), avoids collisions with layers extruding from adjacent geometry, and optionally combines the layered tets into prisms. The implementation in Pointwise automatically ensures consistency of the volume mesh with the adjacent surface meshes, something which previously had to be managed manually. </p>  <p> This new Pointwise release also includes the ability to read geometry data from native CAD formats including ACIS, CATIA V4, CATIA V5, NX, Parasolid, Pro/ENGINEER, SolidWorks, and STEP.

The by-products of this challenge have the potential to impact high-speed rail, ground effects of high-speed aircraft in the landing configuration as well as deceleration methods utilized by high-speed vehicles. </p>  <p> The webinar will demonstrate how to </p>  <ul>  <li>Rapidly generate repeatable, complex, viscous, unstructured meshewith T-Rex</li>  <li>Employ CFD as a cost-effective tool to help an all-volunteer team attempt the world land speed record</li>  <li>Address challenges of designing a stable, low drag wheel system for a supersonic ground vehicle</li>  <li>Efficiently extract drag and stability information from a large number of calculations using EnSight</li>  </ul>  <p> Mr. Grove has been performing CFD analyses using Pointwise for preprocessing, CFD++ from Metacomp for flow solutions, and EnSight from CEI for post-processing to guide the design that will improve the drag and stability characteristics of the NAE vehicle. This webinar will discuss how Mr. Grove used Pointwise and EnSight to help design aft suspension fairings to reduce overall drag on the car while maintaining stability and control. To help validate the CFD simulations, a recent field test at Oregon's Alvord Desert was conducted in which comparisons between experimental and computational results will be shown. </p>  <p> Dr. Sideroff joined Pointwise as a technical sales engineer in September 2007 after working as a petroleum engineer for the NATCO Group, a CAD engineer for ARV Development, and a computer technician for Harddata Ltd. Dr. Sideroff earned both a B.S. and M.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Alberta, in 2000 and 2003. He earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Syracuse University in 2009. </p>  <p> Mr. Carrigan joined Pointwise as a technical sales engineer after completing his M.S. in aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington in May 2011. He interned at Pointwise beginning May 2008, producing demonstration and application videos and working in technical support, doing grid projects and quality assurance testing. During a prior internship at Vought Aircraft Industries, Mr. Carrigan worked as a quality engineer on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Program. He received his B.S. in aerospace engineering in 2009 from UTA. </p>  <p> Mr. Grove holds a B.S. degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Maryland and an M.S. in aeronautical engineering from the Naval Post Graduate School, Monterey, CA. Specializing in CFD and design, with a strong background in wind tunnel and flight testing and IT support, he is experienced in subsonic, transonic, and supersonic aerodynamics. Mr. Grove has more than 18 years' experience in CFD technologies and has worked on programs like the F/A-18E/F and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) for the Naval Air Systems Command, and the Boeing 787, 777, 737MAX, and Open Fan Rotor programs. He analyzed performance on the next generation of aircraft as part of the product development group at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. </p>  <p> Mr. Colburn joined CEI in March 2007 after 14 years in automotive, combustion and aerospace fields as a CFD engineer. He has used a wide variety of tools and techniques in the utilization of CFD within real world design cycles, including seven years using EnSight. Mr. Colburn received his B.S. from Rensselaer Polytechnic University in 1995. </p>  <p> NAE's all-volunteer team, headed by owners Ed Shadle and Keith Zanghi, is using CFD to better understand the complex aerodynamics of a car traveling through the sound barrier. They are using a modified Lockheed F-104 Starfighter as the foundation for the car. A supersonic ground vehicle has to deal with the aerodynamic effects of the ground and the suspension system, which an aircraft does not. The suspension system affects the drag, lift, and stability of the vehicle. Prediction of the drag is crucial to ensuring the modified General Electric J-79 turbo-jet engine delivers enough power to enable the NAE vehicle to reach its 800 mph goal. Understanding the car's stability provides the driver with the confidence that he will be able to control the vehicle as it approaches and passes the sound barrier.

That's why we reached out to Dr. Peter Eiseman, PDC's founder and president, and we agreed to collaborate on this project.&rdquo; </p>  <p> The new release of Pointwise can import structured volume grids from GridPro's file format so they can be integrated into a Pointwise hybrid mesh or otherwise modified. Pointwise also exports both structured and unstructured surface meshes to GridPro for use as geometry on which GridPro can generate a grid. </p>  <p> &ldquo;I am pleased to be working with John Chawner and Pointwise on this collaboration and look forward to seeing our customers reap the benefits of our respective packages, each of which offers distinctive valuable capabilities,&rdquo; said Dr. Eiseman. &ldquo;Precise reliable user control is a hallmark of Pointwise and is very compatiblewith the topology approach of GridPro. The topology paradigm is driven by GridPro's proprietary dynamic boundary conforming technology (DBC), which provides multiblock grids that are optimized for smoothness and orthogonality throughout the regional volume. DBC is often used to provide local resolution to accurately model localized physics in the CFD solution. To inject further control in a reliable precise manner, the user will now be able to import such grids into Pointwise where its precise controls can then be applied for further user modifications.&rdquo; </p>  <p> Pointwise Version 17.1 R4 includes defect corrections and other new capabilities including a new native interface to the TAU CFD solver, a C++ API for writing plugins, support for OpenFOAM&reg; cell sets, and other minor features. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing engineering analysts today &ndash; mesh generation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

The capability is the result of the DBC technology that moves a pattern of points onto a region to yield an optimized grid. The interactive GUI automatically generates the TIL code which structurally looks somewhat like the C/C++ programming languages and provides fully automatic grid generation for each codified pattern. As such, it is worthy to note that TIL codes allow recurrent use and can be assembled in a macro fashion to form yet more exotic codes that for example can efficiently cover cases with recurrent structures.

Fortunately, post-processing T-Rex's tet cells into hexes (12 tets per hex) was a natural extension of the existing tet-to-prism combination algorithm.&ldquo; </p>  <p> T-Rex (anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion) is a highly automated, advancing layer technique for generating a CFD mesh with boundary layer and wake resolution. The technique extrudes layers of high-aspect ratio, right-angle-included tetrahedra outward from a surface mesh. A post-processing operation sequentially combines three successive tetrahedra into a stack of prisms. In this new release of the technique, extrusion from a quadrilateral surface mesh begins with a single pyramid, after which the usual tet extrusion begins. The resulting tets (and that first pyramid) are post-processed into stacks of hexes. </p>  <p> &ldquo;This new hex capability in T-Rex is just the first step of many that will vastly expand the scope of mesh types that Pointwise can generate,&rdquo; said John Chawner, Pointwise's president. &ldquo;We look forward to customer feedback on this first release of unstructured hex cell generation in T-Rex to guide further developments.&rdquo; </p>  <p> Pointwise Version 17.2 also includes updated compatibility with CGNS, FUN3D, ANSYS Gambit, STAR-CD, and SC/Tetra; support for the OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, and CentOS Linux distributions; several productivity improvements; and defect corrections. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing engineering analysts today &ndash; mesh generation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Multi-block structured meshing has the advantage of reducing numerical diffusion and a higher node-to-cell count ratio, making it attractive for problems when accurately predicting performance is key. However, volute features like that of the tongue region, require a significant amount of effort to obtain a purely hexahedral mesh. Volute performance simulations depend critically on the cells nearest the boundary, as the core of the flow typically has relatively low circulation, implying hybrid meshing could potentially provide similar accuracy with more automation. </p>  <p> This webinar will focus on a generic volute design. Simulations were performed using Code Leo, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver developed by ADS, on three different grid types generated with Pointwise: multi-block structured, unstructured with a hexahedral boundary layer, and unstructured with a prismatic boundary layer.

That research was followed by a full year of fine-tuning in preparation for release to all our customers.&rdquo; </p>  <p> Overset gridding is a technique that avoids the topological complexity of generating abutting, point-to-point connected, multi-block grids by allowing the component grid blocks to overlap. The price paid for that flexibility is the need to ensure a sufficient degree of overlap so the CFD solver can accurately share data between the component grids. The overlap is computed using overset grid assembly software. Users of OGA software typically rely on a circuitous collection of home-grown tools that are patched together. By integrating OGA (in the form of the PEGASUS and Suggar++ software packages) with Pointwise, the entire process is made more efficient. </p>  <p> &ldquo;Pointwise has been a proud, long-time sponsor of and participant in the bi-annual Overset Grid Symposium,&rdquo; said John Chawner, Pointwise's president. &ldquo;This release of Pointwise helps us continue our integral relationship with that community.&rdquo; </p>  <p> Other features in Pointwise Version 17.3 R1 include improved support for PLOT3D, ANSYS Fluent, STL, and NX files, a more robust T-Rex, anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion, hybrid mesher, and several user experience enhancements. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) today &ndash; reliably generating high-fidelity meshes.

Fifty years later, Breedlove has decided that it is time to bring the title back to America. In a new team led by Breedlove, the Spirit of America is being revived with the goal of once again claiming a new world record for land-speed vehicles. </p>  <p> Historically, land-speed vehicles were shaped by rule of thumb aerodynamics. However in the 50 years since the first turbojet vehicle officially set a land-speed record, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has matured to a point where it can be inexpensively used to help simulate performance characteristics on such vehicles. One of the largest initial hurdles for Breedlove and his team has been quickly analyzing new designs with limited resources. To that end, TotalSim agreed to help with the preliminary CFD analysis given a restricted budget. The key to success for both parties was generating inexpensive accurate results. </p>  <p> Leveraging Pointwise, TotalSim generated a hybrid grid, balancing mesh generation time and solution accuracy. Pointwise's structured and unstructured meshing techniques coupled with T-Rex (anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion) were used to generate layers of unstructured hexahedra and prisms, helping to reduce the overall cell count and improve grid quality. Additionally, TotalSim was able to exploit the flexibility of Pointwise and manually adapt the grid to help resolve shock structures and more accurately predict vehicle performance. </p>  <p> This webinar will demonstrate how to </p>  <ul>  <li>Simplify a complex geometry using layers for organization</li>  <li>Resolve areas of high curvature using structured meshing techniques</li>  <li>Automatically generate contiguous viscous layers of unstructured hexahedra and prisms </li>  <li>Effortlessly add local refinement to an existing volume mesh to improve solution accuracy</li>  <li>Rapidly assess high-speed vehicle performance on a limited budget</li>  </ul>  <p> Presenters will be <a href=\"../../about/staff.html#carrigan\">Travis Carrigan</a> and Andy Luo from TotalSim. </p>  <p> Andy Luo is a graduate of the University of Southern California where he received a BS in Aerospace Engineering and an MS in Aerospace Design.

To demonstrate this, we introduce a collection of best practices for cleaning complex analytic CAD encountered in the automotive industry and demonstrate a robust meshing technology in Pointwise that can automatically generate high quality boundary layer resolved meshes that retain their quality when morphed by Optimal Solutions' Sculptor during the optimization process. </p>  <p> The case study for this work is the DrivAer model developed by the Institute of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics at the Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen. Using this geometry, we demonstrate a technique called Solid Meshing to heal faults in the geometry and recover the original engineering intent and when coupled with T-Rex (anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion) enables automated, high quality volumetric grid generation. </p>  <p> Using the DrivAer mesh, we define a set of volumetric shape deformations using few design variables within Sculptor. A technology called Arbitrary Shape Deformation is used to smoothly morph the nodes of the mesh that are inside of the volumetric deformation space. Even for large deformations, this technology can maintain surface boundary layer thickness and orientation. </p>  <p> By eliminating the requirement to remesh after each volumetric deformation, solution changes are minimized and primarily subjected to the changes seen by the OpenFOAM flow results due to model differences. Also, all tools have been coupled to form an automated optimization framework making it possible to find the subtle shape changes that produce large improvements in design performance. </p>  <p> This webinar will demonstrate how to </p>  <ul><li>Quickly clean up and organize dirty CAD using Solid Meshing.</li><li>Generate a high quality surface and volume mesh using T-Rex.</li> <li>Save time by directly examining grid quality metrics within Pointwise. </li> <li>Export grid and boundary conditions in native OpenFOAM format.</li> <li>Easily define shape deformation control points using Sculptor.</li> </ul>  <p> Presenters will be Pointwise's <a href=\"../../about/staff.html#carrigan\">Travis Carrigan</a> and Mark Landon from Optimal Solutions. </p>  <p> Mark Landon is the Chief Technology Officer and founder of Optimal Solutions software.

Individual component grids are fitted to portions of the geometry without requiring point matching to other grids. Domain connectivity information (DCI) couples the overlap regions by providing interpolation sources and removing cells that are to be excluded from the computation. The DCI is computed by Suggar++, developed by Celeritas Simulation Technology. Suggar++ is a flexible, overset grid assembly (OGA) package available commercially worldwide. </p>  <p> While the benefits for dynamic grids are obvious, the overset approach can be advantageous for static grids as well because geometry changes require only local changes to the grid system. This flexibility simplifies design studies as new or perturbed geometry can easily be incorporated by only meshing the changed feature. Because the baseline grid system is not altered, changes in the solution are more reflective of the local geometry change rather global grid updates. </p>  <p> The process of generating overlapping grids, setting up and executing Suggar++, and exporting the DCI along with the grid system can all be accomplished within Pointwise. In this webinar, we will highlight several best practices for generating component grids and the procedure for setting up the necessary inputs for Suggar++. Finally, we will demonstrate an overset flow simulation using Caelus, a freely available fork of OpenFOAM&reg; developed by Applied CCM.

Afterwards, from 11 a.m. - noon, our Pointwise engineer who created the grid will be available online to answer your questions. </p>  <p> Improvements in computational power, accessibility to high performance computing (HPC) resources, and open-source tools have recently contributed to the prevalence of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and its widespread adoption across several diverse industries. CFD simulations that leverage sophisticated physical models are regularly used throughout the design cycle to help shape and refine the overall final configuration of a product. </p>  <p> However, ensuring that the computed solutions are sufficiently accurate with respect to the physical system being modeled is often left to the practitioner to determine. Even for relatively standard simulations, questions often arise as to the robustness with which CFD methods can accurately compute outputs of interest. Numerical errors can often be directly traced to the configuration of the underlying mesh and orientation of individual and neighboring cells used in calculating a solution. Error estimation and adaptive methods are critical ingredients to improve the reliability of computational simulations efficiently and reliably. </p>  <p> In this video, we demonstrate some recommended best meshing practices in Pointwise and demonstrate adjoint-based mesh adaptation using NASA Langley's FUN3D solver to accurately compute the flow over an ONERA M6 wing. </p>  <p> This Let's Talk Meshing webcast will demonstrate how to: </p>  <ul> <li>Seamlessly import IGES files into Pointwise</li>  <li>Create Coons patches to easily close gaps in analysis models</li>  <li>Utilize solid modeling techniques to quickly organize models into representative analysis surfaces</li>  <li>Quickly generate farfield and symmetry boundary domains using Pointwise's built-in geometry creation tools</li>  <li>Generate anisotropic surface and volume grids using T-Rex (aniso-tropic tetrahedral extrusion)</li>  <li>Setup mesh and input files necessary for mesh adaptation using FUN3D</li> </ul>  <p> Details on the webcast and Q&amp;A participation can be found at <a href=\"http://info.pointwise.com/webinar-meshing-considerations-adjoint-based-mesh-adaptation\">info.pointwise.com/webinar-meshing-considerations-adjoint-based-mesh-adaptation</a>.

These models are typically similar to each other with only slight variations in shape of the underlying CAD surfaces. Other times these models consist of several components or parts that can be mixed and matched in a variety of configurations. In either scenario, remeshing each individual configuration can be a time consuming and expensive task that inhibits the analysis’ scope. Furthermore, remeshing the entire configuration can cause changes in the analysis results due to global mesh differences and not just due to changes in the configuration. </p>  <p> In this video, we demonstrate a couple of different strategies users can leverage in Pointwise to limit changes to only those localized regions in their computational domain that have been modified from one configuration to the next, helping them spend more time focusing on the results of their parametric studies. </p>  <p> Discover how to: </p>  <ul> <li>Take advantage of Pointwise’s native CAD file import capabilities to have existing surface meshes automatically mapped to changes in underlying CAD surfaces</li> <li>Effectively manage projects using layers to help organize and exchange parts within an assembly</li> <li>Combine component grids quickly using auto merge</li> <li>Copy, paste, and transform components to easily re-use parts that are already meshed</li> <li>Use T-Rex (anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion) features to match cell spacing at interface boundaries when making localized changes to your volume mesh</li> </ul>  <p> Details on the webcast and Q&amp;A participation can be found at <a href=\"http://info.pointwise.com/webinar-localized-remeshing-strategies-parametric-models\">info.pointwise.com/webinar-localized-remeshing-strategies-parametric-models</a>. </p>  <p> The event will be hosted by <a href=\"../../about/staff.html#davis\">Zach Davis</a>. </p>  <p> Let's Talk Meshing events encompass various communication channels, including interactive forums, webinars, and webcasts that inform and equip Pointwise users.

Starting with an existing aircraft geometry, we demonstrate the entire meshing process beginning with the generation of a quad surface mesh. Next, areas of high curvature are resolved, then farfield boundaries are generated using the latest shape creation utilities. The same shape creation utilities are then used to define a source that provides off-body volumetric grid refinement to help track flow features of interest. The volume mesh is generated using T-Rex, our unstructured viscous meshing algorithm, which extrudes stacks of flow-aligned hexahedra and prisms that smoothly transition to an isotropic tetrahedral farfield.

This new Glyph Server feature was motivated by a user’s presentation at the Pointwise User Group Meeting 2016. </p>  <p> &ldquo;The Glyph Server idea arose after talking to the customer who presented his work on 'A Python Binding for the Pointwise Glyph Scripting Language' at our user group meeting,&rdquo; said John Chawner, Pointwise's president. &ldquo;Not only were we able to share new code with the customer to simplify his work but the conversation made us realize how to make Glyph callable from any scripting language.&rdquo; </p>  <p> The new Glyph Server feature lets users execute scripts from within Pointwise written in the scripting language of their choice such as Python, Perl, Lua, and more. The only other required component is the Glyph client code for each language. Pointwise has shared the Glyph clients for Python and Perl on the Pointwise Glyph Script Exchange hosted on GitHub. The former was also made available on the Python Package Index. With this new capability, users can write scripts in the language with which they are most comfortable, make full use of all built-in and third party tools that come with that language, easily interface with all the other scripts their organization has written in that language, and all while customizing and automating mesh generation in Pointwise. </p>  <p> By extending Pointwise's Glyph scripting language to a client-server model, scripts can also perform functions not previously possible. As an example, users will find on the Glyph Script Exchange a Python script with a Tk interface that synchronizes the 3-D view of the mesh in two separate Pointwise instances and creates a composite image of the two thereby enabling direct visual comparison of two meshes. Although just a demonstration, this script offers a glimpse of what is now possible. </p>  <p> Pointwise Version 18.0 R2 also includes several other small new features and bug fixes. </p>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) today – reliably generating high-fidelity meshes.

Designed for speed and stability, Rhino Chasers allow the surfer to drop down the face of the tube and generate enough speed to stay ahead of the crest. These waves can reach upwards of 80-100 feet, and the surfers riding them can reach speeds of 50 mph. To these elite surfers, speed and stability are crucial, allowing them to catch that monster wave, ride it, and ultimately survive it. </p>  <p> Big wave surfboard designs tend to concentrate on hydrodynamics, focusing primarily where the board comes in contact with the water. In contrast, the aerodynamics of the board above the water line are often disregarded. By optimizing the aerodynamic performance of a surfboard, higher speeds and improved stability can be realized. </p>  <p> Working with one of the world’s top big wave board shapers, engineers at CRAFT Tech have applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) within a design optimization process, employing a genetic algorithm to evolve the design of a big wave surfboard. By using the meshing tools provided by Pointwise, and automating the process using Glyph scripting, a large design space was explored to aerodynamically optimize the board’s leading edge design.

This represents a step-change in the way CFD (computational fluid dynamics) engineers can access and utilize high performance meshing &amp; simulation tools. </p>  <h2>Why On-Demand?</h2>  <p> In a previous <a href=\"http://blog.envenio.ca/overcoming-limitations-with-an-on-demand-cloud-solver\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blog</a>, Envenio discussed the limitations facing engineering consultants in their day-to-day lives. Most notably, these limitations affected areas of growth, their ability to compete, and cash-flow, all factors that can directly influence project decisions and business growth. Traditional commercial tools and traditional compute resources have previously been inflexible and expensive, restricting flexibility of consultants and potentially limiting the services they can offer clients. Costly annual licensing subscriptions are now a thing of the past, thanks to new on-demand pay-as-you-go tools. </p>  <p> By being able to access on-demand meshing, simulation tools and post-processing tools, engineers can expand their service offering, exceed client expectations, and keep up with their competition. With these engineering simulation tools, consultants enjoy a significant reduction in meshing time and simulation solve time. Being able to list end-to-end CFD services in marketing and proposal materials also enables consultants to compete with larger organizations. Moreover, engineers are able to: </p>  <ul><li>Upsell existing clients on larger or more complex models</li><li>Offer a higher through-put of meshes and simulations to prospective clients</li><li>Offer shorter turn-around times on simulations</li><li>Upsell existing customers on high resolution meshes / models</li><li>Supplement their existing meshing and simulation workflows using the on-demand tools for additional or more challenging runs</li><li>Bid more competitively on projects</li><li>Provision compute resources on the fly to scale with customer demands</li> </ul>  <p> In instances where a client's needs increase, the use of affordable on-demand cloud CFD tools adds a level of flexibility, enabling consultants to instantly access high performance meshing and simulation resources. </p>  <p> While open source software is a good option for consultants, the lack of urgent technical support can be troublesome. </p>  <p>Financial restrictions are particularly common when it comes to meshing tools and CFD software, and operating a CFD tool on more than four CPUs can become eye-wateringly expensive. In some cases, vendors charge over $1,000 per additional core, and it is worth noting that even fellow &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; providers still require annual license subscriptions in some cases. This is not the case with Envenio, and users protect their cash flow by paying for usage only every 30 days. </p>  <p>With on-demand CFD tools being so in-demand, the alliance between Pointwise, Inc. and Envenio marks an exciting time. If you are interested in a free trial of the on-demand platform, click <a href=\"http://blog.envenio.ca/free-cfd-solver-tria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. </p>  <h2>The Envenio &amp; Pointwise, Inc. Agreement</h2>  <p>This agreement will enable consultants to access both EXN/Aero and Pointwise on-demand. By making software more accessible, engineers are free to progress their research and expand their service offering, increasing the widespread use of CFD. Furthermore, if talented individuals have access to modern software, the potential for innovation across a number of sectors is increased, spelling an exciting future ahead. </p>  <p>&ldquo;We are delighted to have teamed up with Pointwise, Inc.,&rdquo; says VP of Envenio, Scott Walton. &ldquo;We share many of the same values, and are absolutely passionate about ensuring engineering consultants have access to the best CFD tools. This alliance reflects our overall mission to break down barriers and limitations that can prohibit the work of consultants, providing them with flexible access to software that has historically only been available to the largest corporations and organizations. We have used Pointwise internally for over 7 years and believe it is the highest performance meshing tool available&rdquo; he added. </p>  <p>&ldquo;This is our first foray into cloud-based preprocessing so we are happy to have an experienced team like Envenio by our side,&rdquo; says Dr. Rick Matus, Pointwise executive vice president. &ldquo;At first we were skeptical about getting the graphics performance needed for a highly interactive product like Pointwise while working with a remote cloud-server. Our testing with Envenio in the Nimbix environment showed very good results. Users should enjoy the flexibility of on-demand meshing combined with Pointwise’s ease-of-use and high-quality. We are excited to join Envenio in providing this to the engineering community.&rdquo; </p>  <h2>The High Performance Engineer</h2>  <p>Combining Pointwise, a powerful CFD meshing tool and solver with the ability to access it on the cloud and the ability to pay only for what you use enables you to compete, grow, and better manage your cash-flow. Many users run a test case to get a sense of the interface, workflow, and speed up.

In the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), unstructured mesh adaptation has been used to substantially reduce the mesh size needed to reach a desired solution accuracy. Thus, this technique enables significant improvements in processing time, memory requirements, and storage needed. </p>  <p>Error estimates based on the flow solution can detect physical phenomena and give local target mesh lengths needed to capture their behavior. Meshes are then automatically adapted in critical regions without any a priori knowledge of the solution. However, without access to the underlying CAD data, adaptation is limited only to improving off-body grid resolution. Given that access to CAD is available directly within Pointwise, and added or moved grid points can be reprojected onto the underlying geometry during adaptation, which offers a unique advantage over most off-body mesh adaptation solutions. </p>  <p>Topics covered include: </p>  <ul><li>Incorporating the benefits of mesh adaptation into your simulation workflows</li><li>Using Glyph scripting to import point cloud source objects</li><li>Applying mesh adaptation to better resolve critical regions of the flow over the ONERA M6 wing</li> </ul>  <p> <a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) today – reliably generating high-fidelity meshes.

Once a meshing decision is made, it affects not only the types, number, orientation, and placement of grid elements, but also simulation stability, convergence, and accuracy. The mesh generation process therefore plays a critical role in providing accurate, timely results. </p>  <p> Using a marine propeller as a model, the aim is to better understand the relative merits and drawbacks of various meshing strategies. This webinar also focuses on simulation efficiency and its dependence on the mesh generation process. </p>  <p> The meshing strategies considered include two hybrid techniques and structured overset. An approach for computing simulation efficiency is introduced and the process for generating each mesh explored in detail. Best practices are highlighted with an emphasis on mesh quality, and the ease of surface and volumetric refinement. Each mesh is evaluated against the amount of time required to create the mesh, its cell count and quality, the accuracy of the results, and the time needed to run the simulation to a prescribed convergence threshold using CFD++ by Metacomp Technologies. </p>  <p> Topics covered include: </p>  <ul> <li>Defining simulation efficiency</li> <li>Resolving highly curved surfaces using anisotropic refinement</li> <li>Automatically generating hex-dominant and prismatic boundary layer meshes</li> <li>Structured overset meshing considerations</li> <li>Numerical setup and post-processing using CFD++</li> </ul>  <p> For more information or to register, go to <a href=\"http://info.pointwise.com/webinar_best_mesh_strategy\"> info.pointwise.com/webinar_best_mesh_strategy</a>. </p>  <p> Presenters will be <a href=\"../../about/staff.html#carrigan\">Travis Carrigan, Pointwise</a>; Faranggis Bagheri, GoVirtual; and Brian Edge, Metacomp Technologies. </p>  <p> Faranggis Bagheri joined Go Virtual Nordic AB as software support manager in 2014 after working 3.5 years at FS Dynamics Sweden AB as a CFD engineer, providing CFD calculations for different industries.

The kernel's core geometry evaluation functions can provide all the functionality a CFD solver would need for tasks like mesh adaption and elevation of elements to higher-order. We are now seeking additional beta testers to validate this idea.&rdquo; </p>  <p> Project Geode's kernel is a fourth generation, solid modeling and geometry kernel written in C++. It is available on Windows, Linux, and Mac in both 32-bit and 64-bit builds. The kernel's math, geometry, and topology libraries have been packaged together and are now being made available for beta testing. While there are many excellent geometry kernels &ndash; both proprietary and open-source &ndash; currently  available in the market today, the Project Geode kernel is tuned to the needs of engineering simulation, making it fast and light enough to be deployed in a distributed computing environment. Its heritage is the full kernel which forms the basis of Pointwise's geometry-related capabilities. Therefore, the kernel itself is production strength; what is being beta tested is the kernel's utility in simulation software. </p>  <p> Project Geode has been in a limited, preliminary beta test for about a year. One of the early beta testers was the SU2 team at Stanford. Dr. Edwin van der Weide from the University of Twente wrote, &ldquo;We have used Geode to create high order elements for the SU2 Discontinuous Galerkin solver that is currently under development. The available functionality in the kernel allowed us to project the inserted points onto the true surface reliably, leading to curved elements respecting the true CAD geometry.&rdquo; </p>  <p> More information about Project Geode is available at <a href=\"../../geode/\">www.pointwise.com/geode</a>.

This two-year, approximately $700,000 effort will advance Pointwise’s current mesh curving technology and permit mixed order meshes and h-p adaptation in a parallel environment. </p>  <p> Finite element methods are an emerging technology in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These methods are able to handle the highly non-linear nature of aerodynamics with increased accuracy relative to traditional methods. Part of that increase in accuracy derives from the use of meshes in which the cell boundaries are curved by defining them in terms of polynomials of degree greater than or equal to two. However, these types of meshes are challenging to create for the high Reynold’s number flows typically encountered in aerodynamics. </p>  <p> &ldquo;Pointwise has been working on mesh curving technology for several years, and we have generated meshes for many customers as a free service to test and evolve our techniques,&rdquo; said Dr. Steve Karman, principal investigator of the selected proposal. &ldquo;The NASA Phase II funding will allow us to extend that technology to the parallel computing environment and interact directly with a CFD flow solver to automatically adapt the mesh to evolving features in the flowfield.&rdquo; </p>  <p> An integral component of the mesh adaptation portion of the proposal is closely coupling the geometry model of the object being meshed with the CFD flow solver. The proposal discusses use of a mesh-geometry associativity schema and direct geometry access tools in order to create a robust, production-level capability. </p>  <p> Subsequent to successful contract negotiation, work is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018.

This nine-month, approximately $150,000 project will be a proof of concept effort aimed at developing a lightweight geometry kernel for use in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow solvers. </p><p>Traditionally, CFD flow solvers have not had access to the geometry model, only the mesh built on it. Access requires a solid modeling and NURBS (non-uniform rational B-Spline) geometry kernel in order to work with the types of geometry models produced by modern computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Because CFD solvers consume large amounts of compute resources (for example, meshes with hundreds of millions of points), a geometry kernel for a CFD flow solver should be relatively fast and small. Mesh adaptation is one scenario in which a CFD flow solver would use a geometry kernel to ensure that points moved or inserted for solution accuracy remain constrained to the geometry model.</p><p>&ldquo;Pointwise has developed its own geometry kernel over the past several decades,&rdquo; said Nick Wyman, director of applied research. &ldquo;Recently we launched Project Geode, a beta program through which we are sharing the core of our geometry kernel with select customers and partners.

The initial release of this capability in V18.2 allows users to uniformly elevate their meshes to polynomial degree 2, 3 or 4. Under a follow-on NASA Phase II SBIR project the technology will be matured to permit mixed-order meshes and solution-based adapted meshes.&rdquo;</p><p>Pointwise has been fortunate to work with leading researchers across the globe while developing this high-order capability and is honored by their enthusiasm for its release in the production software.</p><p>Dr. Ryan S.

He wrote, &ldquo;The release of Pointwise V18.2 that includes polynomial degree elevation and mesh curving capabilities represents a watershed moment in the history of CFD. With this capability, CFD solutions generated by DoD HPCMP CREATE(TM)-AV Kestrel component COFFE with Pointwise degree 2 meshes contained accurate coefficients of lift and drag with an order of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom than CFD solutions generated by other solvers on other meshes.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Peter Vincent, Reader in Aeronautics and EPSRC Fellow at Imperial College London wrote, &ldquo;Compact high-order schemes can potentially offer industry a range of benefits including accurate and efficient resolution of unsteady turbulent flows. However, such schemes require high-order curved element meshes to work efficiently, and these have proven notoriously difficult to generate in a robust way, especially for complex geometries. I see the addition of such capability to Pointwise as a potential game-changer in this regard, and I am confident it will enable adoption of compact high-order schemes amongst a wider community of fluid dynamicists.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Edwin Van Der Weide from the University of Twente had the following to say: &ldquo;The new degree elevation and mesh curving capability in Pointwise V18.2 enables us to generate high-order grids beyond the academic test cases we could handle with the SU2 in-house mesh deformation tools. As such, these new capabilities give us, and many other groups, the possibility to advance the development of SU2 to the level of industrially relevant configurations.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Z.J. Wang, Spahr professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Kansas and founder of hoCFD LLC, a software company offering a high-order CFD solver, wrote, &ldquo;I am thrilled that Pointwise is releasing a high-order meshing capability because it is considered the biggest bottleneck in high-order CFD simulations.

","newsRelease":"<p>FORT WORTH, TX (22 January 2019) – Pointwise has released the webinar, “High-Order Mesh Generation Using Pointwise.” The webinar addresses the two main challenges tied to the degree elevation of linear elements: boundary conformance and curving of high aspect ratio cells encountered within the boundary layer region and shows how to improve CFD solution accuracy by generating boundary conforming, high-order meshes.</p><p>Watch the webinar at <a href=\"https://info.pointwise.com/webinar-high-order-mesh-generation-using-pointwise\">https://info.pointwise.com/webinar-high-order-mesh-generation-using-pointwise</a>.</p><p>Traditionally, adding cells to a mesh, known as H-refinement, was the primary means by which solution accuracy could be improved. The additional resolution enables the capturing of flow phenomena often diffused by coarser variations of the same mesh. Another technique used to improve spatial and temporal accuracy is by performing degree elevation, both for the assumed solution within a given element and for the element itself. In doing so, linear meshes can become curved with the addition of nodes along edges, faces, and in the interior. Fewer elements are then required to accurately represent curved geometry and capture complex flow features of interest.</p><p>There are two primary challenges associated with the degree elevation of linear elements: boundary conformance and curving of high aspect ratio cells encountered within the boundary layer region. In this webinar, we will address these challenges by demonstrating the generation of a linear mesh for the Rotor 37 geometry, followed by the elevation of the linear mesh. Because geometry-mesh associativity is known, inserted nodes are properly constrained to the underlying geometry. Additionally, our optimization-based smoothing scheme propagates boundary perturbations into the interior of the mesh, ultimately improving the quality of the resulting high-order mesh and ensuring its validity.</p><p><strong>Discover how to:</strong></p><ul><li>Generate high-order meshes using Pointwise V18.2 R1</li><li>Improve meshing efficiency with the latest user interface enhancements</li><li>Quickly apply 2-D T-Rex (anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion) to resolve surface curvature</li></ul><p><a href=\"../../index.html\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) today – reliably generating high-fidelity meshes.

The increased dynamic range presents unique challenges, particularly when generating meshes with the resolution necessary to accurately capture the flow phenomena of primary interest.</p><p>While multi-block structured meshing strategies have dominated the wind energy field, there has been a shift toward hybrid meshing for its ability to more easily adapt to arbitrarily complex blade shapes. In this webinar we describe a hybrid meshing strategy using the Sandia National Labs CX-100 horizontal axis wind turbine blade as a test case that borrows many characteristics from multi-block structured methods without the topological complexity, allowing for quick turn-around times and the ability to minimize the impact a geometry change and subsequent remeshing operations would have on the flow solution.

Current front wing designs are intricate and no two are the same, a testament to the complexity of the flowfield experienced by each vehicle as it makes its way around the track. Simplifying the design and looking at just the twist distribution, there is still little to no agreement found. Hence the purpose of this study. Can we identify the optimal twist distribution for the front wing of a race car that maximizes downforce without increasing drag? It turns out that we can.</p><p>By using ModelCenter from Phoenix Integration as an integration platform, Pointwise to generate the meshes, and AcuSolve to run the CFD calculations, push-button design optimization was achieved. In fact, the model-centric process was built on parametric geometry so that a single mesh could be mapped effortlessly from one design iteration to the next and the final output is an actual CAD model that can be used for further analysis.</p><p>Topics covered in this webinar:</p><ul><li>Formulating the optimization problem including the model and design variables and setting up the integration platform</li><li>Generating a baseline mesh that isolates the area of interest and automating the parametric mapping for each design iteration</li><li>Locating the optimum twist distribution for maximum downforce using a genetic algorithm on a response surface </li></ul><p>Phoenix Integration’s ModelCenter® is a vendor-neutral software framework for creating and automating multi-tool workflows, optimizing product designs, and enabling Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).

With its origins in a multiyear development effort funded by the U.S. Air Force for overset grid assembly, this latest Pointwise release includes a suite of tools that provide increased automation and flexibility in mesh topology creation, mesh types and mesh quality assessment.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t&ldquo;This release is the culmination and commercial manifestation of a two-year $1.2 million research and development effort funded by the U.S. Air Force Materiel Command, Arnold Engineering Development Complex,&rdquo; said Nick Wyman, Pointwise’s director of applied research. &ldquo;That effort in turn was an extension of a previous, two-year, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award. While focused on overset grid assembly, the capabilities added to the software are applicable to virtually any type of mesh generation.&rdquo;\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tFrom the standpoint of mesh topology, Pointwise now includes Frameworks, the ability to generate meshes within coordinate systems local to geometric components (for example, a fuel tank) and then transform them into the global coordinate system (for example, placing the fuel tank below the aircraft’s wing). A new top-down technique called Build Blocks provides rapid volume mesh creation around selected meshes such as would be used for overset refinement. The ability to create surface meshes that are independent of geometry model topology has been simplified with the addition of a curve drawing mode that does not rely on the geometry model’s parametric space.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tVoxel blocks are a new top-down, volume mesh generation technique that quickly encapsulates a boundary layer resolved mesh within a Cartesian grid. Mesh adaptation through the use of sources for overset interpolation remediation now influences the surface mesh in addition to the volume mesh.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tMesh quality assessment now includes filters by which cell visibility can be limited to a range of metric values. Filters also provide the basis for creating point cloud sources for mesh adaptation via the new Snapshot capability. Planar cuts through a mesh can persist outside of the Examine command for monitoring the effect of mesh changes on mesh quality.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tPointwise Version 18.1 also extends the software’s plugin API to provide users with the ability to add, at runtime, their own mesh import capabilities. V18.1 is delivered with new mesh importers for FUN3D, CFD++, OpenFOAM&reg;, SU2, CRUNCH, ANSYS CFX&reg; and ANSYS Fluent&reg;.

Yet, automation in the absence of control and expertise often has limited applicability, including the inability to maintain consistency throughout the design and simulation process. This can result in an inaccurate, and sometimes unreliable, understanding of a design or the design space, slowing the turn-around time and delaying time to market.</p><p>With this in mind, at Pointwise we have been developing a new suite of features called Flashpoint that take the control and expertise we are known for and combines them with deeper automation. Flashpoint, and in particular, the automatic surface meshing component, will help ensure consistency and reliability throughout the meshing process while also providing a framework for encapsulating your organization’s best practices. We recently collaborated with FlexCompute, the developers of Flow360, a new cloud-based CFD solver, and using the NASA Common Research model as our benchmark, we are demonstrating the ability to mesh and run a high-fidelity aircraft simulation in minutes. </p><p><a href=\"../../\">Pointwise, Inc.</a> is solving the top problem facing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) today – reliably generating high-fidelity meshes.
