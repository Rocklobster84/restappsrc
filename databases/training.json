We ask trainees to arrive between\r\n            8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. so we can get everyone registered the first day. We provide breakfast\r\n            snacks so many people spend this time eating and getting to know the other trainees.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n            The class can end early on one or more days, depending on class discussion and additional\r\n            problems trainees may have questions about. Whenever we do finish early, we use that time to\r\n            work with trainees on geometry or grids they bring to class. We are happy to provide\r\n            personalized advice for your own cases and find this helps cement what is learned in class.\r\n        <p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n            The last day is the one most likely to end early. For Fort Worth classes, if you need to book a\r\n            return flight, you probably would be safe in booking it after 5:30 or 6:00 p.m. Central Time.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p><strong>\r\n                I am an advanced user.
