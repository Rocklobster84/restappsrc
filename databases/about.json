Examples would be air over the wing of an airplane and water through a pipe. Engineers in the aerospace industry use CFD to predict aerodynamic lift and drag and engine performance. In the automotive industry, it is used for drag prediction, estimating heating conditions in the engine compartment and for computing the flow in the engine's intake manifold, cylinders and exhaust manifolds. Because CFD reduces the need for expensive testing and gives engineers more insight into their design before it is built, it saves time and money and leads to better designs.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Why Grid Generation is Critical to CFD</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The CFD analysis process, illustrated below, begins with a computer-aided design model of the part being analyzed. Next, the flow region around or through the part is divided into numerous discrete elements call a grid or mesh. Pointwise is the software used to generate the grid. Then, the governing equations for fluid flow are solved for each element, including any interactions between elements, to determine the flowfield. As a last step, useful engineering data like forces, moments, heat transfer and visualizations of vortices and other flow structures are extracted from the numerical flowfield using a post-processor.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <figure>\r\n                    <img data-src=\"images/cfd-process.png\"\r\n                         alt=\"F-18 images\" class=\"img-fluid mx-auto\"/>\r\n                    <figcaption>\r\n                        There are three major steps in the CFD analysis process: meshing, solution and postprocessing. F-18 images courtesy of Metacomp Technologies.\r\n                    </figcaption>\r\n                </figure>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Grid generation is the most time consuming and difficult part of the CFD analysis process. Grid generation often consumes up to 80 percent of the labor hours for a CFD project and is the largest controllable influence on the accuracy of the analysis. Our products are the best solutions available to the grid generation problem. They allow engineers to work with flawed CAD models without any cleanup. Engineers are free to concentrate on producing high quality grids without having to worry about the grid's bookkeeping aspects.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Pointwise Has Over Three Decades of Meshing Experience - And Counting</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Before Pointwise, there was Gridgen. Development of Gridgen began in 1984. During the period 1987-1994, development of Gridgen was funded by the United States Air Force, and NASA Langley and Ames Research Centers. The Gridgen software developed during this period was widely distributed and used throughout government labs, DoD contractors, and academia. In 1994, Gridgen was privatized through a technology transfer agreement with the U.S. Government, and Pointwise was born. The next-generation product, Pointwise, was released in 2007 and couples Gridgen's time-tested suite of meshing techniques with a modern user interface. The company has grown rapidly since its founding and continues to maintain this growth as more and more engineers discover the value of its products and services.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Clients and Partners who Benefit from Mesh Generation Software and Services</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Pointwise's software is currently in use at over 700 sites in countries around the world. The client base is typified by world-class organizations like Lockheed Martin, Northrop-Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and NASA and by leading edge applications such as the space shuttle, Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, Advanced Turbine System, and advanced submarines.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Strategic distributorships have been established in China, Finland, Germany, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Compare this to the building as it appeared circa 1910.\r\n\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&ldquo;The exciting thing about the Pointwise decision to locate their business on the Near South Side of the city is that it reaffirms our belief that high tech, non-medical businesses, and the intellectual talent that accompanies them, can flourish in a mixed-use, central city location,&rdquo; said Don Scott, then-president of Fort Worth South, Inc.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>The property we chose for our corporate home has character.</strong> The historic Bicocchi building was built by Louis Bicocchi. The building is brick with decorative cast stone trim, including triangular corner parapets inscribed with the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo;. The store front facing South Jennings Street is thought to feature the face of Bicocchi's daughter, Sarah Clothilde Bicocchi Jenkins, in cast stone above the name &ldquo;Bicocchi&rdquo;.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"images/bicocchi-B-art-nouveau-detail.jpg\"\r\n\t\t\t\talt=\"The Bococchi building includes art nouveaux architectural details\" class=\"img-fluid mx-auto\"/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe building includes art nouveaux architectural details such as corner parapets with the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; and a casting of the builder's daughter.\r\n\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBicocchi was a prominent grocer and a forward-thinker. His Bread and Ice Depot at 7th and Burnett streets was the first store in Fort Worth to have electric lights and a cash register. Together with Giovanni Battista Laneri in 1899 he founded O.B. Macaroni, the 13th oldest organization in Tarrant County.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Bicocchi Building was used for various enterprises, including ground-floor storefronts and apartments on the second floor, an original example of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-use_development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mixed-use</a> plan that underlies the City of Fort Worth's comprehensive plan.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe two-story brick building was renovated in the 1980s to enhance its original architectural details with a skylighted atrium and a second-story conference room with a view overlooking downtown Fort Worth. We particularly liked the ambiance of exposed interior brick walls and original wooden doors, frames and transom windows, which give our offices a sense of historical significance. Our developer and technical support teams have offices with original 10-foot embossed tin ceilings and plate glass store-front windows, as well. Our off-street entrance is through an atrium that features a brick wall that once was the exterior of the building and which reflects part of the property's history in signage weathered over time.\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"images/bicocchi-interior-updates.jpg\"\r\n\t\t\t\talt=\"renovated office spaces\" class=\"img-fluid mx-auto\"/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe renovated office spaces feature high ceilings and exposed brick (left), the conference room offers a skyline view of downtown Fort Worth through greenhouse-type windows (center), and renovations retained much of the original framing and transoms.\r\n\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&ldquo;There are challenges associated with turning a building more than 100 years old into a modern office space, but we believe the advantages of location and atmosphere are worth it,&rdquo; said John Chawner, president of Pointwise. &ldquo;Fort Worth is a city that appreciates historical context.

When coupled with design optimization algorithms, Sculptor performs automatic CFD shape optimization. These tools help eliminate the numerous iterations inherent in the design process were one modifies the CAD model, remeshes, and then completes the CFD analysis. Optimal Solutions' Arbitrary Shape Deformation (ASD) technology used by Sculptor automatically, in real-time, alters shapes that are typically very complex and hard to manipulate into designs that improve performance - without having to remesh. The deformations are smooth and volumetric to maintain cell quality for the CFD calculations. When coupled with Pointwise's reliable CFD meshing, Sculptor helps find more accurate designs in less time, resulting in appreciable amounts of time and money being saved. <a href=\"http://www.gosculptor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.gosculptor.com</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<hr />\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<a id=\"tecplot\" class=\"anchor\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-lg-2\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"img-fluid\" data-src=\"images/tecplot-logo-175x82.png\" alt=\"Pointwise and Gridgen are compatible with Tecplot's CFD postprocessing software.\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-lg-10\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFounded in 1981, Tecplot delivers visualization software for engineers and scientists who need to analyze, discover, and communicate results.
